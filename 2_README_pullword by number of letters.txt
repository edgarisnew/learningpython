This was my second project, which is working as incrementation towards a bigger project that will be a Scrabble Cheating Program, where
the user inputs a number of letters and the letters they wish to use and the program will give them words that meet that criteria.

This first part was making a program where it would pull a word just by the number of letters the user inputted - it'll probably be updated
in the future to include error messages if the user inputs a number of the allowed ammount or bellow 1 or if they input letters.

Using requests to use MIT's 1000 word list as a data base and using random to skim through the words until they meet the criteria.

While the lenght of the word is not equal to the int of the input, the program chooses another word, when the lenght of said word is equal
it prints the word out.
